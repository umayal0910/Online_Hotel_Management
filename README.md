# Online_Hotel_Management

Online Hotel Management System is using Java by implementing the OOPS Concepts. I have different modules which is 
            1. Getting Customer details
            2. Room booking
            3. Ordering Food
     * Getting Customer details:
              It gets the customer details such as Customer Name, Customer Phone number and their address along with the no.of.users.
     * Room booking:
              Next the customer can book the room type according to their wish like whether Ac , Non-Ac, or Delux rooms. The room price differ for each type of rooms. I have given a different price per day for each type of room. Also a  different booking amount for  each type of room. It also gives the basic information about  different types of room. The room no is allocated.
     * Ordering Food:
              The customer can order food for no of users. The user can order 4 varities of food.The price amount is different for each variety of food. After ordering food they can order coffee or cool drinks if they want. The amount for the coffee and cool drinks is different. The total price will be given including the order of coffee or cool drinks. The booking id is given for each and every order.
              
              
 I have learnt how to use the OOPS concepts in java which are inheritance , encapsulation , etc. This project helped me to improve myself interms of learning the  OOPS concept well in a real life example.
